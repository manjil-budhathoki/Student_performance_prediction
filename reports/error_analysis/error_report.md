## Feature Importance Analysis

Feature importance analysis not available for this model type.

## Recommendations for Model Improvement

### 1. Feature Engineering

- Explore polynomial features for non-linear relationships
- Create domain-specific features (e.g., study-to-absence ratio, activity involvement index)

### 2. Data Quality Improvements

- Investigate outliers in the worst predictions for potential data quality issues
- Consider collecting additional features that might explain high-error cases
- Examine if certain student segments have consistently higher prediction errors

### 3. Model Enhancements

- Experiment with ensemble methods (stacking, blending)
- Try advanced algorithms: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
- Implement cross-validation for more robust hyperparameter tuning
- Consider neural networks for capturing complex patterns

### 4. Error Pattern Analysis

- Over-predictions: 235 (49.1%)
- Under-predictions: 244 (50.9%)
- ✅ Relatively balanced error distribution

### 5. Specialized Models

- Consider building separate models for different GPA ranges (low, medium, high)
- Implement quantile regression to predict GPA ranges instead of point estimates
- Use confidence intervals to communicate prediction uncertainty

## Error Distribution Summary

| Error Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------------|-------|------------|
| Small (≤ 0.25) | 382 | 79.7% |
| Medium (0.25-0.5) | 92 | 19.2% |
| Large (> 0.5) | 5 | 1.0% |

## Conclusion

The tuned model shows strong predictive performance with an R² score of 0.9532. The error analysis reveals specific areas for enhancement, particularly in:

1. Addressing the worst predictions through targeted feature engineering
2. Leveraging feature importance insights for model refinement
